# Test Report for "weather-module" 

The "Weather Module" has been manually tested to ensure its functionality aligns with the expected results. Each function was executed with predefined input data, and the outputs were rigorously compared to the expected values. The tests covered average temperature, humidity calculations, wind speed, and maximum rainfall detection.

## Manual Test Cases

### Test Case ID: TC1
**Title**: Verify Average Temperature Calculation

**Preconditions**: The `WeatherModule` class is properly imported and instantiated with a set of temperature data in Kelvin.

**Input Data**: 
- temperaturesInKelvin: `[173.15, 273.15, 400.15, 200]`

**Steps**:
1. Call the `countAverageTemperature` and `averageTemperatureInCelsiusmethod` method of the `WeatherModule` instance with the input data.
2. Observe the returned value.

**Expected Result**:
- The method should return the average temperature of the input data in Kelvin, formatted to one decimal place.

**Actual Result**: The average temperature in kelvin is around 261.6 K which is (261.6 - 273.15) = -11.5Â°C in Celsius.

**Status**: [Pass]

### Test Case ID: TC2
**Title**: Verify Average Humidity Calculation

**Preconditions**: The `WeatherModule` class is properly imported and instantiated with a set of humidity data.

**Input Data**: 
- humidities: `[4, 6, 2, 8, 7]`

**Steps**:
1. Call the `averageHumidity` method of the `WeatherModule` instance with the input data.
2. Observe the returned value.

**Expected Result**:
- The method should return the average humidity, formatted to one decimal place.

**Actual Result**: The average humidity is: 4 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 7 = 27, 27/5 = 5.4.

**Status**: [Pass]

### Test Case ID: TC3
**Title**: Verify Wind Speed Calculation

**Preconditions**: The `WeatherModule` class is properly imported and instantiated with a set of wind speed data.

**Input Data**: 
- windSpeeds: `[1, 5, 2, 3]`

**Steps**:
1. Call the `averageWindSpeed` method of the `WeatherModule` instance with the input data.
2. Observe the returned value.

**Expected Result**:
- The method should return the average windSpeed, formatted to one decimal place.

**Actual Result**: The average wind speed is: 1 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 11, 11/4 = 2.8.

**Status**: [Pass]

### Test Case ID: TC4
**Title**: Verify Rainfall Calculation

**Preconditions**: The `WeatherModule` class is properly imported and instantiated with a set of rainfall data.

**Input Data**: 
- rainfall: `[2, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4]`

**Steps**:
1. Call the `maxRainfall` method of the `WeatherModule` instance with the input data.
2. Observe the returned value.

**Expected Result**:
- Maximum rainfall amount.

**Actual Result**: The max rainfall at : 2, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4 is '9'.

**Status**: [Pass]
